My Favorite City — Static Blog
=================================

A responsive, multi‑page HTML & CSS template built for a "My Favorite City" project.

Structure
--------
/index.html            — Home with hero + featured & recent posts
/attractions.html      — Card grid of top attractions
/culture.html          — Culture & food write‑ups
/gallery.html          — Responsive photo gallery (CSS Grid)
/contact.html          — Contact form + map image placeholder

/css/style.css         — Styles (mobile‑first, Grid/Flex)
/images/               — Placeholder images (SVG/JPG)

How to Use
----------
1. Replace images in /images/ with your city photos (keep file names or update <img> src).
2. Edit text content in the HTML files (search for headings and paragraphs).
3. Tweak colors in :root within css/style.css (e.g., --accent, --accent-2).
4. Optional: Embed a real Google Map by replacing the map image in contact.html with an <iframe>.

Fonts
-----
Headings use **Poppins**, body text in prose sections uses **Merriweather**. Both are loaded from Google Fonts in each page.

Accessibility
-------------
• Semantic landmarks: <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>  
• Focus styles on inputs, high‑contrast theme, and aria labels on key UI.
